# Machine Learning Steps

the notebook we used to created the model is 'bangkit_dmgSev.ipynb'. Here is a summary of the steps we did:

1. Download then extract the data
2. Exploring, prepare the data using pandas and imageDataGenerator
3. Create CNN model and train the data using tensorflow
4. Improve model using transfer learning
