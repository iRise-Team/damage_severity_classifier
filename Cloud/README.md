Here is the step by step of what Cloud Learning Path do in this capstone project:
- Prepare the project in GCP for the team.
- Set budget and alerting for the first $100.
- Create cloud storage buckets to store machine learning model and code to run the server.
- Prepare the infrastructure to run the server in the cloud including virtual machine instance, firewall, and static IP.
- Install all the requirements to run the server and machine learning model in the virtual machines instance.
- Run the server using screen to avoid the server stop when the ssh is closed.
- Connect the server running in the virtual machine instance to the front-end (android) via external IP to run the machine learning model and predict the image.
- Set an authenthication in Firebase for register/login in the android application.

There's also some things that we already prepared but are not used:
- SQL Database
- Firestore Database in Firebase
